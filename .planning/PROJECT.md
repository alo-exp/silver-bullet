# Silver Bullet

## What This Is

Agentic Process Orchestrator for AI-native Software Engineering & DevOps. Silver Bullet combines GSD, Superpowers, Engineering, and Design plugins into enforced workflows with 7 layers of compliance — guiding users from idea to deployed software without requiring any prior knowledge of the underlying tools.

## Core Value

Single enforced workflow that eliminates the gap between "what AI should do" and "what AI actually does" — 7 compliance layers, zero single-point-of-bypass, complete user hand-holding from start to finish.

## Requirements

- ✓ Multi-repo spec referencing with version pinning — v0.14.0
- ✓ Step non-skip enforcement §3/§3a/§3d — v0.14.0

### Active

- [ ] Granular artifact review rounds: every artifact-producing step gets dedicated reviewer with 2-consecutive-clean-pass enforcement
- [ ] New reviewer skills/agents for 8 artifact types (SPEC, DESIGN, REQUIREMENTS, ROADMAP, CONTEXT, RESEARCH, INGESTION_MANIFEST, UAT)
- [ ] Existing reviewers formalized into same framework (plan-checker, code-reviewer, verifier, security-auditor)
- [ ] Workflow integration: producing steps wired to invoke reviewer before completing
- [ ] v0.14.0 critical bug fixes: shell injection in silver-ingest, heredoc injection in pr-traceability.sh
- [ ] v0.14.0 verification gaps: Confluence [ARTIFACT MISSING], version mismatch diff

### Out of Scope

- Replacing GSD's execution engine — GSD owns execution, SB orchestrates
- Admin/utility GSD commands (gsd-manager, gsd-settings, gsd-stats, gsd-note, etc.) — accessible but not guided
- Modifying third-party plugin files — §8 boundary enforced
- Building custom integrations for external tools — use Claude Desktop MCP connectors / CLIs
- Nomadic Care-specific naming conventions or file structures — SB provides generic patterns

## Current Milestone: v0.15.0 Granular Artifact Review Rounds

**Goal:** Every artifact produced by any SB/GSD workflow step gets iterative review rounds with a dedicated reviewer — 2 consecutive clean passes required before the step completes. No artifact ships without structured quality validation.

**Target features:**
- A: New artifact reviewers (~8 new skills/agents for SPEC, DESIGN, REQUIREMENTS, ROADMAP, CONTEXT, RESEARCH, INGESTION_MANIFEST, UAT)
- B: Existing reviewer formalization (plan-checker, code-reviewer, verifier, security-auditor into same 2-pass framework)
- C: Workflow integration (producing steps wired to invoke reviewer before completing)
- D: v0.14.0 critical bug fixes (shell injection, heredoc injection, verification gaps)

## Context

- Stack: Node.js (shell hooks, markdown skills, HTML site)
- Repository: https://github.com/alo-exp/silver-bullet.git
- GSD version: 1.32.0 (~60 commands, wave-based parallel execution)
- Superpowers version: 5.0.5 (14 skills — code review, TDD, debugging, branch mgmt)
- Engineering/Design: Anthropic knowledge-work-plugins (6+6 skills)
- Current version: v0.13.2 (Hook hardening + init hook registration)

## Constraints

- **Plugin boundary**: Must not modify GSD/Superpowers/Engineering/Design plugin files (§8)
- **Enforcement integrity**: All 7 enforcement layers must remain functional during and after restructuring
- **Template parity**: docs/workflows/ must always match templates/workflows/
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing .silver-bullet.json configs must continue to work

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| silver-bullet.md.base is single source for enforcement §0-9 | One template, no drift | ✓ Good |
| CLAUDE.md.base reduced to minimal scaffold | User owns CLAUDE.md, SB owns silver-bullet.md | ✓ Good |
| Update mode overwrites silver-bullet.md without confirmation | SB-owned file | ✓ Good |
| GSD owns execution, SB owns orchestration + enforcement | Clean separation of concerns | ✓ Good |
| Forensics: evolve (GSD-aware routing), don't remove | SB forensics handles session-level issues GSD doesn't | — Pending |
| 20 GSD commands guided, ~40 unguided | Core SDLC + select utilities only | — Pending |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd-complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
